Given a binary tree, find its height.

Input:
     1
    /  \
   2    3
Output: 2

Code:

class Solution{
    public:
    //Function to find the height of a binary tree.
    int height(struct Node* node){
        if(node==NULL){
            return 0;
        }
        int leftheight = height(node->left);
        int rightheight = height(node->right);
        return 1+max(leftheight,rightheight);
    }
};
